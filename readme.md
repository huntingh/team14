Keeping up with the current trend of multi-factor authentication, the purpose of this project is to create a layered defense from unauthorized personnel accessing private property. The multi-factor authentication safe will feature RFID for primary authentication. The user will have to be in the range of the scanner or tap the ID card for authentication, and if the user is verified, the second authentication method will activate. The second layer of authentication is a fingerprint scanner that will be trained during the setup phase. If both steps were successful, the lock in the safe will open. The overall system will be controlled through an Arduino, and authentication status and battery power status will be shown through LEDs.

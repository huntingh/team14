"RFID Scanner - RC522"

This program uses Arduino libraries: <SPI.h>, <MFRC522.h>

The module that is used in this subsystem is RC522 but it is compatible with MFRC522 Arduino library.
The software should read the data of the unique key and determine the validity.
If valid, it should authenticate the user and allow to proceed to the next step of authentication, which is fingerprint scanner.
If not, it should remain idle until valid key is presented.

This Github branch includes the code/pseudocode of RC522 implementation and the activity diagram of the software.
